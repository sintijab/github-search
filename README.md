Code Challenge: github repository finder

The goal of this challenge is to build a github repository finder app. Please use the Github GraphQL API Endpoint with the Apollo Client. To prevent you from wasting time to setup the environment: we use Create React App. You only have to insert your [github Authentication Token](https://github.com/settings/tokens/new) in `App.js#11` You can start the app with `npm start` or `yarn start`.

If you have any questions, don't hesitate to ask. You don't have to complete all steps. The challenge is scheduled for 90 minutes. Have fun! We are curious to see your result.

## Step 1

Add a search field. The user uses this field to search for a repository. Depending on the query, the app suggests possible repositories (name).

## Step 2

Upon confirmation, the repository should be added to a card view with following information:

* name
* owner with name and picture
* forkCount, watchers, stargazers

## Step 3

It would be great if the app has loading states.

## Step 4

Add the possibility to delete a card.

## Step 5

Save the repository selection so that the user can see the previous selection next time.
